        <p>Lory's project was to come up with a different design to set Lory apart from the other realtors and their template websites. I designed the layout, 
        graphics and slices in photoshop and hand coded xhtml/css in Dreamweaver. Lory's website has SEO friendly URLs and gets a lot of traffic.</p><br />
