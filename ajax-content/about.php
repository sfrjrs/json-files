    <!-- About JsonFiles -->
    <h2>About JsonFiles</h2>
    <p>This site is a place where I can work on and update my skills as a designer. I constantly try and improve my skillset so I have more to 
    offer my employer. I have recently been working with the jQuery javascript library and found there are many useful plug-ins that enhance the user interaction 
    with the website.</p>
    
    <!-- Where it all began -->
    <h2>Where it all began</h2>
    <p>I have always had a passion for art and figured it would be hard to make a living painting portraits and landscapes so, I decided to learn how to make art 
    with the computer. After High School I went to a private art college where I earned my associates degree in graphic design and pursued a career in the printing 
    industry.</p>
    <p>Since then I ended up working as a graphic designer for a small mom and pop web development company in Dana Point, Ca. where I would make graphics for print 
    and web projects and they taught me how to write code to update their clientâ€™s websites. Ever since then I have been continuously learning new techniques and 
    honing my skills to provide a better experience for online user interaction.</p>
    <p>I like to constantly learn new things so I regularly take courses and search for new techniques used in the industry to keep me up-to-date on new technology.</p>
