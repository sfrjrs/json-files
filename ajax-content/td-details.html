        <p>After finishing the Explore project I started on redesigning Toshiba's e-commerce website www.ToshibaDirect.com.</p><br />
        <p>My role was to create a style guide similar to the Explore project and create photoshop mock-ups of every page. 
        Once the photoshop page design was approved I would then code every page. I would hand code each page using XHTML/CSS and trouobleshoot for 
        browser issues in IE6, IE7, FF1.5, FF2 and FF3 and then hand the page off to one of the developers to add logic. I would usually work with the developers to
        get the dynamic page content to flow correctly and provide graphic/html/css support when needed by the other developers.</p><br />
