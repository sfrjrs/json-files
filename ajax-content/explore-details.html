        <p>I was brought in to the Toshiba Explore project as a consultant to help build this new Toshiba website.</p><br />
        <p>My role was to take the existing style guide and photoshop mock-ups and create every pages in photoshop to match the style guide. 
        Once the photoshop page design was approved I would then move into coding the page. I would hand code each page using XHTML/CSS and trouobleshoot for 
        browser issues in IE6, IE7, FF1.5, FF2 and FF3 and then hand the page off to one of the developers to add logic. I would usually work with the developer to 
        get the dynamic page content to flow correctly.</p><br />
