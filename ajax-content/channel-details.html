        <p>After finishing the Toshiba Direct project I started on redesigning Toshiba's B2B Channel Reseller website www.sell.Toshiba.com.</p><br />
        <p>My role was to create a style guide to match the other Toshiba projects and redesign all exisiting pages in photoshop. 
        Once the photoshop designs were approved, I would then code every page using XHTML/CSS and jQuery. While coding, I would trouobleshoot for browser issues in
        IE6, IE7, FF1.5, FF2, FF3 and then update static content in the database. I would usually work with the developers to get the dynamic page content to flow 
        correctly and provide graphic/html/css support when needed by the other developers.</p><br />
