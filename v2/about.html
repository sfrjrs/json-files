        <p>My name is Jason and I am a front end web designer. I went to Platt Art College after high school and was formally trained as a graphic designer for the 
        print industry. I always had a passion for the web and decided that I was going to try and learn to build websites while incorporating my style into each 
        project. I eventually got hired at a small web development company called CyberLive in Dana Point, Ca. where I would create print and web graphics for 
        projects we maintained. CyberLive was a great little company to work for and they taught me a lot. CyberLive taught me how to update their clients shopping 
        carts in Dreamweaver and that began the process of learning for me. I then had a brief web designer position in Anaheim and then got hired on at Advanced 
        Access.</p>
        <br />
        
        <div class="my-interest-txt"></div>
        
        <p>Advanced Access was a great place to work. When I started at Advanced Access, it was a small family owned company. I worked in the web design department 
        with four other talented designers that I learned a lot from and eventually worked my way up to Sr. Web Designer.</p>
        <br />
        
        <p>After Advanced Access I started consulting. I picked up a small contract before working for Toshiba America Information Systems, Inc. At Toshiba I was 
        involved in redesigning four of their websites. The first was their support website at www.support.Toshiba.com which has since been redesigned. The next was
        building Toshiba's product brochure site http://explore.Toshiba.com which also has a custom built content management system that I help build. After the 
        explore project I started on the redesign of www.ToshibaDirect.com which is Toshiba's B2C e-commerce website. The last project for Toshiba was the 
        redesigning of Toshiba's B2B Channel Reseller website www.sell.Toshiba.com. Working at Toshiba was a really great experience. Our development team of 
        employees and consultants were some of the most talented Managers, Network Admins, QA, Developers and Designers that I have ever been involved with.</p>
